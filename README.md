1. **Frechet distance**
	
	When solving problems in which it is necessary to take into account the geometric properties of sets, there is a need to quantify the similarity of the shapes of areas, curves and other objects.
	There are different ways to estimate the similarity of sets. Among them is the Frechet distance introduced to estimate the similarity of curves.
